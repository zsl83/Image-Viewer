Image Viewer 
This program is written in Java language.
This program allows you to choose an image from your computer and perform several operations on it, including displaying the image, resizing it, adjusting its brightness, and converting it to grayscale.
When the program is executed, the following sequence of events occurs:


1. Launch Application:

 The main window of the "Image Viewer" application is displayed with several buttons: "Choose Image", "Show Image", "Brightness", "Gray scale", "Resize", and "Exit".

2. Choose Image:

When the "Choose Image" button is clicked, a file chooser dialog opens, allowing the user to select an image file from their computer.

3. Show Image:

Clicking the "Show Image" button opens a new window displaying the selected image in its original form.

4. Grayscale Conversion:

Clicking the "Gray scale" button opens a new window displaying the selected image converted to grayscale.

5. Resize Image:

Clicking the "Resize" button switches the main window to a resize panel where the user can input the desired width and height for the image

After entering the dimensions and clicking "Show Result", a new window opens displaying the resized image.

6. Adjust Brightness:

Clicking the "Brightness" button switches the main window to a brightness panel where the user can input a brightness factor (between 0 and 1).

After entering the brightness factor and clicking "Result", a new window opens displaying the image with adjusted brightness.

7. Exit Application:

 Clicking the "Exit" button closes the application.

8. Navigation:

In the resize and brightness panels, there is a "Back" button that returns the user to the main panel.  
    
This sequence allows the user to select an image, view it, convert it to grayscale, resize it, adjust its brightness, and navigate back and forth between different panels of the application. 
Each transformation results in a new window displaying the modified image.
